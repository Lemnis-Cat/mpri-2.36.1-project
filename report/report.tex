\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The present document is the report of my submission for the programming project
of the MPRI\footnote{\emph{Master Parisien de Recherche en Informatique}
  (Parisian Master of Research in Computer Science)} course ``Proof of
Program''\footnote{\url{https://marche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/lecture-deductive-verif/}}.
Both the
subject\footnote{\url{https://marche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/lecture-deductive-verif/takuzu.pdf}}
and a skeleton
file\footnote{\url{https://marche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/lecture-deductive-verif/takuzu.zip}}
can be found on the course web page.

My submission, as well as this report, can be found on
GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Lemnis-Cat/mpri-2.36.1-project}}.
A documented version of my code is also provided in appendix~\ref{solving-takuzu-puzzles}

\section{Appetizers: Basic Functions on Arrays}
\label{sec:appetizers}

\subsection{Check for consecutive zeros}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The predicate \texttt{no\_3\_consecutive\_zeros\_sub} is simply the
  following:
  \begin{align*}
         & \mathtt{no\_3\_consecutive\_zeros\_sub}(a,l)\\
    \iff & \forall i\in\mathbb{N}, 0 \leq i < l-2 \implies \neg(a[i] \wedge a[i+1] \wedge a[i+2])
  \end{align*}

  The predicate \texttt{no\_3\_consecutive\_zeros} derives naturally:
  \begin{align*}
         & \mathtt{no\_3\_consecutive\_zeros}(a) \\
    \iff & \mathtt{no\_3\_consecutive\_zeros\_sub}\left(a, \mathtt{Array.length}(a)\right)
  \end{align*}

\item For this function, the given implementation was (also shown
  in~\ref{question-2}):
\begin{minted}{ocaml}
let no_3_consecutive_zeros_version_1 a =
  try
    for i=0 to Array.length a - 3 do
      if a[i] = 0 && a[i+1] = 0 && a[i+2] = 0 then raise TripleFound;
    done;
    True
  with TripleFound -> False
  end
\end{minted}
  The contract of this function is:
  \mint{ocaml}|result = True <-> no_3_consecutive_zeros a|
  It captures the fact that this function checks whether the array has no three
  consecutive zeros.
  
  To prove this code  correct, I need to add this loop invariant:
  \mint{coq}|no_3_consecutive_zeros_sub a (i+2)|
  This invariant capture the fact that the sub array the program already
  checked has no three consecutive zeros.
  It is initially true because the antecedent of the predicate is always false
  (when $i=2$ there is no $j$ such that $0 \leq j < i-2$).
  It is preserved at each iteration because the algorithm performs the only test
  that decides $\mathtt{no\_3\_consecutive\_zeros\_sub a (i+3)}$ and is not
  decided by $\mathtt{no\_3\_consecutive\_zeros\_sub a (i+2)}$.

  The post-condition then follows by definition of $\mathtt{no\_3\_consecutive\_zeros}$.


\item This function is implemented as follows (also shown in~\ref{question-3}):
\begin{minted}{ocaml}
let no_3_consecutive_zeros_version_2 a =
  if a.length < 3 then True else
  let ref last2 = a[0] in
  let ref last1 = a[1] in
  try
    for i=2 to Array.length a - 1 do
      let v = a[i] in
      if v = 0 && last1 = 0 && last2 = 0 then raise TripleFound;
      last2 <- last1;
      last1 <- v;
    done;
    True
  with TripleFound -> False
  end
\end{minted}
  This function is very similar to the one before, and simply has a little
  performance upgrade.

  The contract of this function is the same as before.
  To prove it correct, I specified the meaning of \texttt{last1} and
  \texttt{last2}:
  \mint{coq}|last1=a[i-1] /\ last2=a[i-2] /\ no_3_consecutive_zeros_sub a i|
  The loop invariant is obviously initially true and preserved at each
  iteration, thus the post-condition holds.


\item This function is implemented as follows (also shown in~\ref{question-4}):
\begin{minted}{ocaml}
let no_3_consecutive_zeros_version_3 a =
  let ref count_zeros = 0 in
  try
    for i=0 to Array.length a - 1 do
      if a[i] = 0 then
        if count_zeros = 2 then raise TripleFound
        else count_zeros <- count_zeros + 1
      else count_zeros <- 0
    done;
    True
  with TripleFound -> False
\end{minted}
  The contract of this function is the same as before.
  To prove it correct, I needed a loop invariant that captured the precise
  meaning of \texttt{count\_zeros}:
\begin{minted}{coq}
0 <= count_zeros <= 2 /\
count_zeros <= i /\
(count_zeros = 1 -> a[i-1] = 0) /\
(i > 0 -> (a[i-1] = 0 -> count_zeros >= 1)) /\
(i > 1 -> (a[i-1] = 0 = a[i-2] <-> count_zeros = 2)) /\
(a[i] = 0 /\ count_zeros = 2 -> not no_3_consecutive_zeros_sub a (i+1)) /\
no_3_consecutive_zeros_sub a i
\end{minted}

\end{enumerate}
